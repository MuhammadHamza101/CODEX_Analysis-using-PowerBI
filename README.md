## CODEX Beverages Customer Insights with Power BI (Methodology Focus)

This repository showcases a data analysis project methodology using Power BI to extract potential customer insights and recommend marketing strategies for CODEX, a German beverage company. 

**Project Overview:**

This project simulates an analysis of customer survey data to understand customer preferences, buying habits, and brand perception. By leveraging Power BI's data visualization capabilities, the project outlines a process for identifying key trends and opportunities for CODEX to improve sales and marketing strategies.

**Analysis Methodology:**

This section details the steps involved in a typical customer survey data analysis project using Power BI. While the specific data points are not included, the methodology demonstrates the thought process and approach.

1. **Data Acquisition (Simulated):** This step would involve obtaining customer survey data from CODEX in a secure manner. 
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** The data would be cleaned and prepared for analysis in Power BI. This may involve handling missing values, formatting data types, and ensuring data consistency.
3. **Customer Segmentation (Simulated):** Customers would be segmented based on relevant criteria such as demographics, purchase behavior, or product preferences.
4. **Visual Storytelling with Power BI:** Various visuals (e.g., bar charts, pie charts, maps) would be created within a Power BI report to effectively communicate potential key findings from the customer survey data.


**Benefits for CODEX (Potential):**

* Gain a deeper understanding of their customer base.
* Identify areas for product improvement and marketing optimization.
* Make data-driven decisions to increase sales and brand loyalty.

**Technologies Used:**

* Microsoft Power BI

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the repository** 
2. **Download Power BI Desktop:** Download and install Power BI Desktop from [https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/)

**Disclaimer:**

This project is for demonstration purposes only and does not include the actual customer survey data due to confidentiality agreements.

**Future Work:**

* Integrate additional data sources (e.g., sales data) for a more comprehensive analysis (This would require access to additional confidential data).
* Develop interactive dashboards for further exploration of customer insights (This would require the actual data).
* Deploy the Power BI report to a Power BI Service workspace for wider accessibility (This would require the actual data and access to a Power BI Service workspace).
